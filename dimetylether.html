Methods of Manufacturing
The preparation of dimethyl ether from methanol in the presence of acidic catalysts on a laboratory scale has been known for many years. ... Aliphatic ethers can be prepared by heating alcohols in the presence of zinc chloride. Other suitable catalysts are iron chloride, copper sulfate, copper chloride, manganese chloride, aluminum chloride, aluminum sulfate, chromium sulfate, alums, thorium compounds, aluminum oxide, titanium oxide, barium oxide, silica gel, and aluminum phosphate. Aluminum oxide and aluminum silicate, with or without doping, are the most important catalysts for industrial use.
