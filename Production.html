      <p>Approximately 50,000 tons were produced in 1985 in Western Europe by dehydration of methanol:

2 CH3OH â†’ (CH3)2O + H2O
The required methanol is obtained from synthesis gas (syngas). In principle, the methanol could be obtained from organic waste or biomass. Other possible improvements call for a dual catalyst system that permits both methanol synthesis and dehydration in the same process unit, with no methanol isolation and purification.

Both the one-step and two-step processes above are commercially available. Currently, there is more widespread application of the two-step process, since it is relatively simple and start-up costs are relatively low. There is also a one-step liquid-phase process in development.</p>
