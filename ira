<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Dimethyl ether (DME) is an organic compound with the simplest CH 3 OCH 3 formula. The simplest Ether, is a colorless gas which is a useful precursor for other organic compounds and aerosol propellants. When burned, dimethyl ether produces at least NOx and CO, although the formation of HC and carbon black is significant. DME can act as a clean fuel when burned with a properly optimized engine for DME.</p>
<p style="color:MediumSeaGreen;">Dimethyl ether (DME), also known as methoxymethane, is an organic compound with the formula CH3OCH3, simplified to C2H6O. The simplest ester, it is a colorless gas that is a pioneer useful for other organic compounds and aerosol propellants that are currently being shown for use in a variety of fuel applications. This is an ethanol isomer</p>
